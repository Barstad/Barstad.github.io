# Hi, I'm Johannes Barstad ðŸ‘‹

I have been doing deep learning professionally since 2017. For the past few years,
I have been working at oda.com as a machine learning engineer, building the
personalization platform. I'm very interested in transformers and their applications both
in language modeling, but also in other domains. I first applied them to problems in personalization
and recommendations back in 2020, and have worked a lot with them since. 

My goal with this blog is to share my learnings and insights about transformers, deep learning and
other fun topics in the field of AI and ML.
